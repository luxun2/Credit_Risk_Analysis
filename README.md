# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a supervised machine learning model that could accurately predict credit risk. In order to complete this task, I used 6 different methods, which are:

Create supervised machine learning models to predict credit risk. Using imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to create target variables, train the model, and to get accuracy and confusion matrices. The accuracy, precision, and recall scores can be observed below for 

*Naive Random Oversampling, 

*SMOTE Oversampling, 

*Cluster Centroid Undersampling, 

*SMOTEENN Sampling, 

*Balanced Random Forest Classifying, 

*Easy Ensemble Classifying.

Summary:

There is a summary of the results (2 pt). There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification (3 pt)


To see if there is a credit risk we should focus on a model that looks over the least amount of high risk loans. So we need to focus on our recall rate for high risk.

The one that scored the highest for recall was the Easy Ensamble Classifying one with 92%. 

We can also recommendt this model due to it's high accuracy and high precesion compared to all the other models.
